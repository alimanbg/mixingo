  "micro_explanation": "🇬🇧 English & French share a 'Cognate Goldmine' — ~45% of English vocabulary has French origins from the Norman Invasion. We leverage your existing knowledge.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which French word is a direct cognate of 'difference'?",
      "options": ["différence", "différent", "différer", "diffus"],
      "correct_answer": "différence",
      "feedback": "Perfect! différence = difference — same meaning, slightly different spelling. English and French share ~45% vocabulary; 29% of modern English words are directly from French. You're using your built-in advantage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Match the English word to its French equivalent: 'class'",
      "options": ["classe", "classeur", "classification", "classique"],
      "correct_answer": "classe",
      "feedback": "Classe = class — almost identical! After 1066, French became the language of law and government in England for 350 years. Your warm-up 'important' question showed this: many -ant words are identical in French."
    },
    {
      "question": "'Montagne' in French means...",
      "options": ["mountain", "month", "money", "monument"],
      "correct_answer": "mountain",
      "feedback": "Montagne = mountain — you can see the connection! English speakers are 'power users' of French vocabulary from day one. Around 50% of the first 1,000 most common English words stem from French."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the 'on' in 'bon' (good) pronounced?",
      "options": ["like 'own' in English", "nasal sound (air through nose + mouth)", "like 'on' in English", "silent"],
      "correct_answer": "nasal sound (air through nose + mouth)",
      "feedback": "🇨🇳 Cantonese speakers: 人 (lang) involves simultaneous oral and nasal airflow — very similar to French nasal vowels in 'enfant'. English has no equivalent; this is where interference happens. Practice builds this new sound."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which word contains a French nasal vowel?",
      "options": ["pain (bread)", "parler (to speak)", "merci (thank you)", "table (table)"],
      "correct_answer": "pain (bread)",
      "feedback": "'Pain' has the nasal 'in' — air exits through both mouth and nose. Cantonese 人 (lang) mirrors this. For Mandarin/English speakers, nasal vowels are the tricky part after the vocabulary head start."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 'maison' (house) masculine or feminine?",
      "options": ["masculine (le)", "feminine (la)"],
      "correct_answer": "feminine (la)",
      "feedback": "La maison. Most nouns ending in -aison are feminine. Unlike vocabulary (where English helps), noun gender is new for English and Chinese speakers — a growth area, not a transfer."
